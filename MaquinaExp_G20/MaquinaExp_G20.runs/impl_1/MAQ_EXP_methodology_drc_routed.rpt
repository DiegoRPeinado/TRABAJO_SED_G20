LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell CTR/ERROR_SIG_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) CTR/PAGO_OK_SIG_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.

LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell CTR/PAGO_OK_SIG_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) CTR/PAGO_OK_SIG_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell SYNC/CUENTA_SIG[4]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) CTR/CUENTA_SIG_reg[0]/CLR, CTR/CUENTA_SIG_reg[1]/CLR,
CTR/CUENTA_SIG_reg[2]/CLR, CTR/CUENTA_SIG_reg[3]/CLR

The latch CTR/ERROR_SIG_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin CTR/ERROR_SIG_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch CTR/PAGO_OK_SIG_reg/L7 (in CTR/PAGO_OK_SIG_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin CTR/PAGO_OK_SIG_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 2 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
